## Introduction

This analysis explores advanced combinations of ConvexValue data parameters to create powerful trading signals and regime indicators for the Elite Options Trading System. By leveraging the rich dataset provided by ConvexValue, we can develop sophisticated metrics that offer deeper insights into market structure and potential price movements.

## 1. Directional Conviction Metrics

### 1.1 Put-Call Flow Divergence Indicator (PCFDI)

**Formula:**
```
PCFDI = (value_call_bs / value_call_buy) - (value_put_bs / value_put_buy)
```

**Explanation:**
This metric measures the divergence between call and put buying/selling activity, normalized by their respective volumes. When positive, it indicates stronger bullish conviction (more aggressive call buying relative to put buying). When negative, it suggests stronger bearish conviction.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- PCFDI > 0.5: Strong bullish conviction
- PCFDI < -0.5: Strong bearish conviction
- Crossing from negative to positive: Potential bullish reversal
- Crossing from positive to negative: Potential bearish reversal

**Visualization:**
Oscillator with zero centerline and standard deviation bands at ±0.5, ±1.0, and ±1.5.

### 1.2 Greek Imbalance Flow Indicator (GIFI)

**Formula:**
```
GIFI = (deltas_call_buy + deltas_put_sell) / (deltas_call_sell + deltas_put_buy) * 
       sign((gammas_call_buy + gammas_put_sell) - (gammas_call_sell + gammas_put_buy))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric combines delta and gamma flows to identify directional positioning with convexity confirmation. The ratio measures directional bias (bullish vs bearish positioning), while the sign function ensures that gamma positioning aligns with delta positioning for stronger signals.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- GIFI > 2.0: Strong bullish positioning with gamma confirmation
- GIFI < -2.0: Strong bearish positioning with gamma confirmation
- GIFI near 1.0: Neutral positioning or conflicting signals

**Visualization:**
Oscillator with threshold lines at ±1.5 and ±2.5.

### 1.3 Volatility-Adjusted Ratio Spread (VARS)

**Formula:**
```
VARS = ((value_call_ratio - value_put_ratio) / volatility) * 
       (1 + abs(oi_ch / oi))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric normalizes the difference between call and put value ratios by implied volatility, then amplifies the signal based on open interest changes. This helps identify directional bets that are significant relative to current volatility expectations and are backed by meaningful position changes.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- VARS > 2.0: Strong bullish signal with volatility confirmation
- VARS < -2.0: Strong bearish signal with volatility confirmation
- Rapid change in VARS: Potential regime shift

**Visualization:**
Time series with colored zones for different signal strengths.

## 2. Market Regime Detection Metrics

### 2.1 Volatility Regime Indicator (VRI)

**Formula:**
```
VRI = (vegas_call_buy - vegas_call_sell) / (vegas_put_buy - vegas_put_sell) * 
      sign(value_bs) * (1 + abs(spread / bid_price))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric identifies volatility regime shifts by comparing vega flows in calls versus puts, adjusted by overall market direction and liquidity conditions. It helps detect when sophisticated traders are positioning for volatility expansion or contraction.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- VRI > 1.5: Volatility expansion regime likely (calls gaining vega)
- VRI < -1.5: Volatility contraction regime likely (puts gaining vega)
- Rapid change in VRI: Imminent volatility regime shift

**Visualization:**
Oscillator with threshold lines and background color indicating current regime.

### 2.2 Theta-Gamma Regime Indicator (TGRI)

**Formula:**
```
TGRI = (thetas_call_buy + thetas_put_buy) / (thetas_call_sell + thetas_put_sell) * 
       sign((gammas_call_buy + gammas_put_buy) - (gammas_call_sell + gammas_put_sell))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric identifies market regimes based on the relationship between theta and gamma flows. When traders are buying both theta and gamma, they're positioning for range-bound markets with potential for explosive moves. When selling both, they're positioning for trending markets with decreasing volatility.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- TGRI > 1.5: Coiled spring regime (range-bound with potential breakout)
- TGRI < -1.5: Trend continuation regime (directional with decreasing volatility)
- TGRI near zero with high absolute value: Regime in transition

**Visualization:**

### 2.3 Liquidity Stress Indicator (LSI)

**Formula:**
```
LSI = (spread / back_volatility) * 
      (1 + abs((bid_size - ask_size) / (bid_size + ask_size))) * 
      (1 + abs(tick_direction))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric identifies periods of liquidity stress by normalizing the bid-ask spread by historical volatility, then adjusting for bid-ask size imbalances and recent price action. High values indicate potential liquidity crunches that often precede significant price moves.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- LSI > 2.0: Severe liquidity stress, potential for sharp moves
- LSI increasing rapidly: Deteriorating market conditions
- LSI decreasing after spike: Potential mean reversion opportunity

**Visualization:**
Time series with threshold lines at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0.

## 3. Advanced Flow Analysis Metrics

### 3.1 Multi-Timeframe Flow Momentum (MTFM)

**Formula:**
```
MTFM = (0.5 * volmbs_5m + 0.3 * volmbs_15m + 0.15 * volmbs_30m + 0.05 * volmbs_60m) / 
       (0.5 * volatility * sqrt(volm_5m) + 0.3 * volatility * sqrt(volm_15m) + 
        0.15 * volatility * sqrt(volm_30m) + 0.05 * volatility * sqrt(volm_60m))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric creates a weighted average of flow across multiple timeframes, normalized by volatility-adjusted volume. This provides a more comprehensive view of flow momentum while giving more weight to recent activity.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- MTFM > 0.7: Strong positive flow momentum across timeframes
- MTFM < -0.7: Strong negative flow momentum across timeframes
- MTFM crossing zero: Potential shift in flow direction

**Visualization:**
Oscillator with zero centerline and colored zones for different signal strengths.

### 3.2 Greek Flow Divergence Indicator (GFDI)

**Formula:**
```
GFDI = ((deltas_buy - deltas_sell) / volm) - 
       ((gammas_buy - gammas_sell) / volm) * volatility * 100
```

**Explanation:**
This metric identifies divergences between delta and gamma flows, normalized by volume and adjusted for volatility. When delta flows are positive but gamma flows are negative, it suggests traders are taking directional positions while hedging against volatility. When both are aligned, it suggests stronger conviction.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- GFDI > 0.5 with both components positive: Strong bullish conviction
- GFDI < -0.5 with both components negative: Strong bearish conviction
- GFDI with opposite signs for components: Hedged positioning, lower conviction

**Visualization:**

### 3.3 Premium-to-Size Anomaly Detector (PSAD)

**Formula:**
```
PSAD = (value / volm) / (theo * volatility) * 
       sign(value_bs) * (1 + abs(oi_ch / oi))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric identifies unusual premium activity relative to theoretical value and volatility. High positive values indicate aggressive buying at premium prices, while high negative values indicate aggressive selling at discount prices. The metric is amplified by open interest changes to highlight significant positioning.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- PSAD > 2.0: Unusual premium buying, potential informed bullish positioning
- PSAD < -2.0: Unusual premium selling, potential informed bearish positioning
- Extreme PSAD values: Possible information asymmetry or upcoming catalyst

**Visualization:**

## 4. Strike-Specific Analysis Metrics

### 4.1 Strike Magnetism Index (SMI)

**Formula:**
```
For each strike:
SMI = (gxoi * sign(dxoi)) * (1 + abs(oi_ch / oi)) * 
      (1 - min(1, abs(strike - price) / (price * 0.05)))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric identifies strikes with strong "magnetic" properties based on gamma exposure, delta bias, open interest changes, and proximity to current price. High positive values indicate potential support levels, while high negative values indicate potential resistance levels.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- SMI > 1000: Strong support level with high probability of price attraction
- SMI < -1000: Strong resistance level with high probability of price repulsion
- Clusters of high absolute SMI: Key price levels for range trading

**Visualization:**

### 4.2 Strike Liquidity Concentration Index (SLCI)

**Formula:**
```
For each strike:
SLCI = (bid_size + ask_size) / (spread * volatility) * 
       (1 + gxvolm / max(gxvolm across all strikes))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric identifies strikes with unusually high liquidity relative to their spread and volatility, adjusted for gamma activity. High values indicate strikes where market makers are actively providing liquidity and managing gamma exposure.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- SLCI > 2.0: Highly liquid strike with active market maker presence
- SLCI < 0.5: Illiquid strike with potential for slippage
- Rapid change in SLCI: Changing market maker positioning

**Visualization:**

### 4.3 Strike Sentiment Divergence (SSD)

**Formula:**
```
For each strike:
SSD = ((value_call_bs / value_call_buy) - (value_put_bs / value_put_buy)) * 
      (1 + abs(oi_ch / oi)) * (1 - min(1, abs(strike - price) / (price * 0.05)))
```

**Explanation:**
This metric identifies strikes where call and put sentiment diverge significantly, adjusted for open interest changes and proximity to current price. High positive values indicate bullish sentiment at that strike, while high negative values indicate bearish sentiment.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- SSD > 0.7 at strikes above current price: Bullish sentiment for upside targets
- SSD < -0.7 at strikes below current price: Bearish sentiment for downside targets
- SSD with opposite sign of price-strike difference: Contrarian positioning

**Visualization:**

## 5. Composite Regime and Signal Frameworks

### 5.1 Market Structure Composite Index (MSCI)

**Formula:**
```
MSCI = 0.3 * normalized(PCFDI) + 
       0.3 * normalized(GIFI) + 
       0.2 * normalized(VRI) + 
       0.2 * normalized(TGRI)
```

**Explanation:**
This composite index combines directional conviction and regime indicators to provide a comprehensive view of market structure. It helps identify periods of strong directional bias, volatility regime shifts, and potential turning points.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- MSCI > 0.7: Strong bullish market structure
- MSCI < -0.7: Strong bearish market structure
- MSCI near zero with high component variance: Conflicted market structure
- Rapid change in MSCI: Potential regime shift

**Visualization:**

### 5.2 Options Flow Intensity Index (OFII)

**Formula:**
```
OFII = sign(value_bs) * 
       sqrt(abs(value_bs) / max(abs(value_bs) over 20-day window)) * 
       (1 + abs(MTFM)) * 
       (1 + abs(oi_ch / oi))
```

**Explanation:**
This composite index measures the intensity of options flow relative to recent history, adjusted for multi-timeframe momentum and open interest changes. High absolute values indicate unusually strong flow that often precedes significant price moves.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- OFII > 2.0: Extremely strong bullish flow
- OFII < -2.0: Extremely strong bearish flow
- OFII increasing in absolute value: Building momentum
- OFII decreasing after extreme reading: Potential exhaustion

**Visualization:**
Oscillator with threshold lines and historical percentile markers.

### 5.3 Options Market Regime Classifier (OMRC)

**Formula:**
```
Compute the following regime indicators:
- Directional Bias: sign(PCFDI + GIFI)
- Volatility Regime: sign(VRI)
- Flow Intensity: abs(OFII) > 1.5
- Liquidity Condition: LSI > 1.5

Then classify the market regime based on these indicators.
```

**Explanation:**
This framework classifies the current market regime based on directional bias, volatility expectations, flow intensity, and liquidity conditions. It helps traders adapt their strategies to the prevailing market conditions.

**Signal Interpretation:**
- Bullish Trend: Positive directional bias, low volatility, high flow intensity
- Bearish Trend: Negative directional bias, low volatility, high flow intensity
- Bullish Volatility: Positive directional bias, high volatility, high flow intensity
- Bearish Volatility: Negative directional bias, high volatility, high flow intensity
