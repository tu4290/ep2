# Market Regime Analysis: Comprehensive ConvexValue Metrics Guide

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive guide presents an advanced framework for market regime analysis using ConvexValue metrics. After thorough analysis of all available parameters, we've identified the most powerful metric combinations for each of the four primary market regimes: bullish, bearish, trending, and choppy/range-bound.

For each regime, we've developed five specialized metric combinations that work synergistically to provide:
1. Confirmation of the current regime
2. Optimal entry and exit signals within the regime
3. Early warning of potential regime shifts
4. Risk management guidance specific to each regime

The power of this framework comes not from individual metrics but from their synergistic combinations, which exponentially increase signal quality and reliability. When multiple metrics align, they create high-conviction signals with significantly higher win rates and returns than any single metric alone.

## I. Understanding Market Regimes

### Regime Definitions and Characteristics

**Bullish Regime**
- Sustained upward price movement with relatively low volatility
- Strong buying pressure and positive sentiment
- Price typically trades above key moving averages with higher lows
- Characterized by institutional accumulation and positive gamma exposure

**Bearish Regime**
- Sustained downward price movement with varying volatility
- Strong selling pressure and negative sentiment
- Price typically trades below key moving averages with lower highs
- Characterized by institutional distribution and negative gamma exposure

**Trending Regime**
- Strong directional movement (either up or down) with momentum continuation
- Low mean reversion and consistent directional flow
- Can be either bullish trending or bearish trending
- Characterized by strong institutional participation and aligned options positioning

**Choppy/Range-Bound Regime**
- Price oscillation within a defined range
- High mean reversion and lack of directional conviction
- Balanced buying/selling pressure
- Characterized by volatility compression and clear support/resistance boundaries

### Regime Identification Framework

The first step in applying this system is correctly identifying the current market regime. We've developed a Regime Probability Dashboard that calculates the strength of all regime metrics simultaneously, providing a probabilistic view of the current market state.

Key indicators for each regime:

**Bullish Regime Indicators**
- Sustained positive values in net flow metrics
- Call gamma dominance near current price
- Institutional call buying activity
- Declining or stable volatility

**Bearish Regime Indicators**
- Sustained negative values in net flow metrics
- Put gamma dominance near current price
- Institutional put buying activity
- Elevated or rising volatility

**Trending Regime Indicators**
- Strong and consistent directional bias in flow metrics
- Options positioning aligned with price direction
- Low mean reversion in price action
- Institutional participation in the trend direction

**Choppy Regime Indicators**
- Oscillating values around zero in flow metrics
- Balanced gamma exposure between calls and puts
- High mean reversion in price action
- Volatility compression
