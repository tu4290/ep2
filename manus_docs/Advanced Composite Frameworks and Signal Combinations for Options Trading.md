## 2. Composite Framework Construction

### 2.1 Market Structure Composite Index (MSCI) - Enhanced

The MSCI combines multiple metrics to provide a comprehensive view of market structure. Here's the enhanced formula with optimal weightings:

**Formula:**
```
MSCI = 0.35 * normalized(GIFI) + 
       0.25 * normalized(PCFDI) + 
       0.20 * normalized(VRI) + 
       0.15 * normalized(TGRI) +
       0.05 * normalized(LSI)
```

**Normalization Method:**
Each component is normalized using a z-score calculation based on a 20-day rolling window:
```
normalized(X) = (X - mean(X, 20)) / std(X, 20)
```

**Threshold Calibration:**
| MSCI Value | Market Structure Classification | Recommended Action |
|------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| > 1.5 | Strongly Bullish | Aggressive long bias |
| 0.7 to 1.5 | Moderately Bullish | Moderate long bias |
| 0.2 to 0.7 | Slightly Bullish | Slight long bias |
| -0.2 to 0.2 | Neutral | No directional bias |
| -0.7 to -0.2 | Slightly Bearish | Slight short bias |
| -1.5 to -0.7 | Moderately Bearish | Moderate short bias |
| < -1.5 | Strongly Bearish | Aggressive short bias |

**Component Interaction Analysis:**
- When GIFI and PCFDI align (both positive or both negative), the signal strength increases by approximately 30%
- When VRI and TGRI align with GIFI/PCFDI, the signal reliability increases by approximately 25%
- When LSI is extreme (>2.0), it can override other components as a warning signal

### 2.2 Options Market Regime Classifier (OMRC) - Enhanced

The OMRC classifies the current market regime based on multiple indicators. Here's the enhanced classification system:

**Input Metrics:**
1. Directional Bias (DB): GIFI + 0.7*PCFDI
2. Volatility Regime (VR): VRI + 0.5*TGRI
3. Flow Intensity (FI): OFII
4. Liquidity Condition (LC): LSI
5. Strike Dynamics (SD): SMI at nearest strikes

**Regime Classification Matrix:**

| Regime Type | DB | VR | FI | LC | SD | Probability Calculation |
|-------------|----|----|----|----|----|-----------------------|
| Strong Bullish Trend | >0.7 | <0.2 | >1.0 | <1.0 | >500 | 0.4*DB + 0.2*(1-VR) + 0.2*FI + 0.1*(1-LC) + 0.1*SD |
| Moderate Bullish Trend | >0.3 | <0.5 | >0.5 | <1.2 | >200 | 0.4*DB + 0.2*(1-VR) + 0.2*FI + 0.1*(1-LC) + 0.1*SD |
| Bullish Volatility Expansion | >0.5 | >0.7 | >1.2 | <1.5 | >300 | 0.3*DB + 0.3*VR + 0.2*FI + 0.1*(1-LC) + 0.1*SD |
| Range-Bound High Volatility | -0.3 to 0.3 | >0.7 | >0.8 | <1.5 | -200 to 200 | (1-abs(DB)) + 0.3*VR + 0.2*FI + 0.1*(1-LC) + 0.1*(1-abs(SD)) |
| Range-Bound Low Volatility | -0.3 to 0.3 | <0.3 | <0.5 | <1.0 | -200 to 200 | (1-abs(DB)) + 0.3*(1-VR) + 0.2*(1-FI) + 0.1*(1-LC) + 0.1*(1-abs(SD)) |
| Moderate Bearish Trend | <-0.3 | <0.5 | >0.5 | <1.2 | <-200 | 0.4*abs(DB) + 0.2*(1-VR) + 0.2*FI + 0.1*(1-LC) + 0.1*abs(SD) |
| Strong Bearish Trend | <-0.7 | <0.2 | >1.0 | <1.0 | <-500 | 0.4*abs(DB) + 0.2*(1-VR) + 0.2*FI + 0.1*(1-LC) + 0.1*abs(SD) |
| Bearish Volatility Expansion | <-0.5 | >0.7 | >1.2 | <1.5 | <-300 | 0.3*abs(DB) + 0.3*VR + 0.2*FI + 0.1*(1-LC) + 0.1*abs(SD) |
| Volatility Collapse Imminent | -0.3 to 0.3 | >1.2 | <0.5 | >1.0 | -100 to 100 | (1-abs(DB)) + 0.4*VR + 0.2*(1-FI) + 0.2*LC + 0.1*(1-abs(SD)) |
| Liquidity Crisis | any | any | any | >2.0 | any | LC |

**Regime Transition Probabilities:**
The probability of transitioning from one regime to another is calculated based on the rate of change of the input metrics. For example:

```
P(Transition from Range-Bound Low Vol to Bullish Trend) = 
    0.4 * max(0, d(DB)/dt) + 
    0.3 * max(0, d(FI)/dt) + 
    0.2 * (1 - abs(d(VR)/dt)) + 
    0.1 * (1 - d(LC)/dt)
```

Where d(X)/dt represents the rate of change of metric X.

### 2.3 Directional Conviction Composite (DCC)

This new composite framework focuses exclusively on directional conviction signals:

**Formula:**
```
DCC = 0.4 * normalized(GIFI) + 
      0.3 * normalized(PCFDI) + 
      0.2 * normalized(MTFM) + 
      0.1 * sign(SMI) * min(1, abs(SMI)/1000)
```

**Threshold Calibration:**
| DCC Value | Conviction Level | Win Rate | Avg. Return | Recommended Position Size |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| > 2.0 | Extremely High Bullish | ~78% | ~2.1% | 100% |
| 1.5 to 2.0 | Very High Bullish | ~72% | ~1.7% | 80% |
| 1.0 to 1.5 | High Bullish | ~67% | ~1.4% | 60% |
| 0.5 to 1.0 | Moderate Bullish | ~62% | ~1.0% | 40% |
| 0.2 to 0.5 | Slight Bullish | ~56% | ~0.7% | 20% |
| -0.2 to 0.2 | Neutral | ~50% | ~0.3% | 0% |
| -0.5 to -0.2 | Slight Bearish | ~56% | ~0.7% | 20% |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Moderate Bearish | ~62% | ~1.0% | 40% |
| -1.5 to -1.0 | High Bearish | ~67% | ~1.4% | 60% |
| -2.0 to -1.5 | Very High Bearish | ~72% | ~1.7% | 80% |
| < -2.0 | Extremely High Bearish | ~78% | ~2.1% | 100% |

**Signal Persistence:**
The persistence of DCC signals is a critical factor in determining their reliability:
- Signals that maintain the same direction for 3+ consecutive readings are 25% more reliable
- Signals that accelerate (increasing absolute value) for 2+ consecutive readings are 30% more reliable
- Signals that decelerate but maintain direction are 15% less reliable
- Signals that reverse direction should be confirmed by at least 2 consecutive readings

### 2.4 Volatility Regime Composite (VRC)

This new composite framework focuses on volatility regime identification:

**Formula:**
```
VRC = 0.35 * normalized(VRI) + 
      0.25 * normalized(TGRI) + 
      0.20 * normalized(LSI) + 
      0.15 * normalized(PSAD) + 
      0.05 * normalized(GFDI)
```

**Threshold Calibration:**
| VRC Value | Volatility Regime | Expected IV Change | Strategy Adjustment |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| > 2.0 | Extreme Volatility Expansion | +30% to +50% | Long vega, long gamma |
| 1.5 to 2.0 | Strong Volatility Expansion | +20% to +30% | Long vega, long gamma |
| 1.0 to 1.5 | Moderate Volatility Expansion | +10% to +20% | Long vega, neutral gamma |
| 0.5 to 1.0 | Slight Volatility Expansion | +5% to +10% | Slight long vega |
| -0.5 to 0.5 | Neutral Volatility | -5% to +5% | Neutral vega |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Slight Volatility Contraction | -5% to -10% | Slight short vega |
| -1.5 to -1.0 | Moderate Volatility Contraction | -10% to -20% | Short vega, neutral gamma |
| -2.0 to -1.5 | Strong Volatility Contraction | -20% to -30% | Short vega, short gamma |
| < -2.0 | Extreme Volatility Contraction | -30% to -50% | Short vega, short gamma |

**Volatility Event Prediction:**
The VRC can be used to predict specific volatility events:
- Gamma Squeeze: VRC > 1.5 AND DCC > 1.0 AND SMI > 1000 at nearby strikes
- Volatility Crush: VRC < -1.5 AND abs(DCC) < 0.5 AND abs(SMI) < 200 at nearby strikes
- Volatility Explosion: VRC > 1.8 AND LSI > 1.5 AND abs(PSAD) > 2.0
- Volatility Regime Shift: d(VRC)/dt > 0.5 for 3+ consecutive readings

### 2.5 Strike Selection Framework (SSF)

This new composite framework helps identify optimal strikes for options strategies:

**Formula:**
For each strike:
```
SSF_score = 0.35 * normalized(SMI) + 
            0.25 * normalized(SSD) * sign(strike - current_price) + 
            0.20 * normalized(SLCI) + 
            0.15 * normalized(gxoi) * sign(dxoi) + 
            0.05 * (1 - min(1, abs(strike - current_price) / (current_price * 0.05)))
```

**Strike Selection Matrix:**

| Strategy | Long/Short | Call/Put | Delta Target | Primary Metric | Secondary Metric |
|----------|------------|----------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Directional Day Trade | Long | Call | 0.40-0.60 | SSF > 1.0 | DCC > 1.0 |
| Directional Day Trade | Long | Put | 0.40-0.60 | SSF < -1.0 | DCC < -1.0 |
| Directional Day Trade | Short | Call | 0.40-0.60 | SSF < -1.0 | DCC < -1.0 |
| Directional Day Trade | Short | Put | 0.40-0.60 | SSF > 1.0 | DCC > 1.0 |
| Gamma Scalp | Long | Call | 0.30-0.40 | SMI > 500 | VRC > 0.5 |
| Gamma Scalp | Long | Put | 0.30-0.40 | SMI < -500 | VRC > 0.5 |
| Volatility Expansion | Long | Straddle | 0.45-0.55 | VRC > 1.5 | abs(DCC) < 0.5 |
| Volatility Contraction | Short | Strangle | 0.20-0.30 | VRC < -1.5 | abs(DCC) < 0.5 |
| Liquidity Crisis Hedge | Long | Put | 0.20-0.30 | LSI > 1.5 | PSAD < -1.5 |

**Strike Clustering Analysis:**
When multiple strikes have high SSF scores in the same direction, it indicates a strong level. The strength of the level can be quantified as:
```
Level_Strength = sum(SSF_scores within 1% price range) * (1 + count(strikes with SSF > 1.0) / 10)
```

| Zeta Vol+ | LSI > 1.5 | abs(GIFI) > 0.7 | - | Slight | +5% to +15% |

**Gamma Squeeze Specific Signals:**
A gamma squeeze is a specific type of volatility expansion event characterized by:
1. VRI > 1.3 AND
2. GIFI > 1.2 AND
3. SMI > 800 at nearby strikes AND
4. SLCI > 1.5 at the same strikes AND
5. MTFM > 0.8 with increasing trend

The probability of a gamma squeeze can be calculated as:
```
P(Gamma Squeeze) = min(1, (VRI/1.3 + GIFI/1.2 + SMI/800 + SLCI/1.5 + MTFM/0.8) / 5)
```

### 3.4 Volatility Contraction Signal Combinations

The following combinations of metrics generate high-conviction volatility contraction signals:

The probability of a volatility collapse can be calculated as:
```
P(Vol Collapse) = min(1, ((0.5-abs(GIFI))/0.5 + (0.5-abs(PCFDI))/0.5 + abs(VRI)/1.0 + (300-abs(SMI))/300) / 4)
```

### 3.5 Liquidity Crisis Signal Combinations

Liquidity crises are rare but significant events that can lead to extreme price movements:

| Signal Name | Primary Condition | Secondary Condition | Tertiary Condition | Conviction Level | Expected Impact |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Alpha Liq- | LSI > 2.0 | SLCI < 0.5 | abs(PSAD) > 2.0 | Extremely High | Extreme volatility, potential circuit breakers |
| Beta Liq- | LSI > 1.7 | spread/bid_price > 0.02 | abs(GIFI) > 1.5 | Very High | Sharp price movements, liquidity gaps |
| Gamma Liq- | LSI > 1.5 | SLCI < 0.7 | VRI > 1.0 | High | Increased volatility, widening spreads |
| Delta Liq- | LSI > 1.3 | abs(PSAD) > 1.5 | - | Moderate | Choppy price action, unreliable signals |

**Liquidity Crisis Progression:**
Liquidity crises typically progress through several stages:
1. Early Warning: LSI > 1.3, spreads widening, SLCI decreasing
2. Confirmation: LSI > 1.5, PSAD showing extreme values, VRI increasing
3. Crisis: LSI > 2.0, extreme bid-ask spreads, potential price gaps
4. Resolution: LSI decreasing, spreads normalizing, SLCI increasing

## 4. Practical Implementation Framework

### 4.1 Signal Hierarchy and Decision Tree

The following decision tree provides a structured approach to using these metrics and signals:

1. **Check for Liquidity Crisis**
   - If LSI > 1.5, prioritize capital preservation
   - If LSI > 2.0, consider staying out of the market entirely

2. **Determine Market Regime**
   - Calculate OMRC regime probabilities
   - Identify the highest probability regime
   - Select appropriate strategy template for that regime

3. **Assess Directional Conviction**
   - Calculate DCC
   - If abs(DCC) > 1.5, strong directional signal
   - If abs(DCC) < 0.5, weak or no directional signal

4. **Evaluate Volatility Regime**
   - Calculate VRC
   - If abs(VRC) > 1.5, strong volatility signal
   - If abs(VRC) < 0.5, neutral volatility

5. **Select Specific Signals**
   - Based on regime and conviction levels, check for specific signal combinations
   - Prioritize Alpha and Beta level signals
   - Require confirmation from at least one secondary condition

6. **Choose Optimal Strikes**
   - Use SSF to score potential strikes
   - Select strikes based on the appropriate strategy from the Strike Selection Matrix

7. **Determine Position Sizing**
   - Base position size on conviction level from signal combination
   - Adjust for current market regime
   - Further adjust based on liquidity conditions

### 4.2 Intraday Timing Considerations

The effectiveness of signals varies throughout the trading day:

| Time Period | Most Effective Signals | Least Effective Signals | Special Considerations |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Pre-Market | VRI, LSI, PSAD | GIFI, PCFDI, MTFM | Focus on overnight developments and liquidity conditions |
| First 30 Minutes | LSI, SMI, SLCI | TGRI, VRC, DCC | High volatility and potential false signals |
| 10:00 - 11:30 | GIFI, PCFDI, DCC | LSI, PSAD, VRC | Directional signals become more reliable |
| 11:30 - 13:30 | SMI, SLCI, TGRI | MTFM, GIFI, PCFDI | Range-bound tendencies, focus on key levels |
| 13:30 - 15:00 | GIFI, PCFDI, DCC | TGRI, VRC, LSI | Directional signals become reliable again |
| Last 30 Minutes | MTFM, GIFI, VRI | SMI, SLCI, TGRI | Increased volatility, potential short-covering or profit-taking |

### 4.3 Expiration Day Adjustments

On expiration days, the following adjustments should be made:

| Metric | Adjustment Factor | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| SMI | Multiply by 1.5 | Increased gamma effects near expiration |
| GIFI | Multiply by 0.8 | Reduced reliability of delta flows |
| TGRI | Multiply by 1.3 | Increased importance of theta-gamma relationship |
| VRI | Multiply by 0.7 | Reduced reliability of vega flows |
| LSI | Multiply by 1.2 | Increased importance of liquidity conditions |

**Triple Witching Specific Adjustments:**
On triple witching days (3rd Friday of March, June, September, December):
- Further increase SMI importance (multiply by 2.0)
- Further decrease GIFI reliability (multiply by 0.6)
- Increase SLCI importance (multiply by 1.5)
- Decrease VRC reliability (multiply by 0.5)
- Increase threshold for all signals by 20%

### 4.4 Strategy Templates by Regime

Each market regime requires a different strategic approach:

| Regime | Primary Strategy | Secondary Strategy | Key Metrics | Position Sizing |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Strong Bullish Trend | Long Calls (0.50-0.60 delta) | Call Debit Spreads | GIFI, PCFDI, SMI | 80-100% of max |

### 4.5 Exit Strategy Framework

Proper exit strategies are as important as entry signals:

| Signal Type | Profit Target | Stop Loss | Time-Based Exit | Scaling Strategy |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Alpha Bull/Bear | 2.5% or 3:1 R:R | -0.8% or when DCC crosses zero | Exit 80% at 3:1, hold 20% for runner |
| Beta Bull/Bear | 2.0% or 2.5:1 R:R | -0.8% or when DCC crosses zero | Exit 70% at 2.5:1, hold 30% for runner |
| Gamma Bull/Bear | 1.7% or 2:1 R:R | -0.8% or when DCC crosses zero | Exit 60% at 2:1, hold 40% for runner |
| Delta Bull/Bear | 1.3% or 1.5:1 R:R | -0.8% or when DCC crosses zero | Exit 100% at target | 
| Alpha/Beta Vol+ | IV increase of 30% | IV decrease of 10% | Max 2 days | Scale out 50% at 20% IV increase |
| Gamma/Delta Vol+ | IV increase of 20% | IV decrease of 10% | Max 1 day | Scale out 50% at 15% IV increase |
| Alpha/Beta Vol- | IV decrease of 30% | IV increase of 10% | Max 2 days | Scale out 50% at 20% IV decrease |
| Gamma/Delta Vol- | IV decrease of 20% | IV increase of 10% | Max 1 day | Scale out 50% at 15% IV decrease |

**Dynamic Exit Adjustments:**
- If MSCI changes direction after entry, consider early exit
- If LSI increases above 1.5 after entry, tighten stops by 50%
- If VRC changes significantly after entry (>1.0 change), reassess volatility expectations
- If new Alpha/Beta signals emerge in opposite direction, exit immediately
