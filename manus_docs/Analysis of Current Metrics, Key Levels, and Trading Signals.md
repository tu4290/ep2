# Analysis of Current Metrics, Key Levels, and Trading Signals

## 1. Current Metrics Analysis

### 1.1 Delta Adjusted Gamma Exposure (DAG)

**Current Implementation:**

**Strengths:**
- Provides a more nuanced view than raw GEX by incorporating directional bias
- Identifies strikes where dealer hedging is most likely to influence price
- Serves as a primary component in MSPI for key level identification

**Limitations:**
- Fixed coefficients don't adapt to volatility regimes or time to expiration
- Overreliance on open interest data which can be stale for intraday trading
- Limited temporal weighting for recent flow data
- Insufficient responsiveness to rapid market structure changes

### 1.2 Skew and Delta Adjusted GEX (SDAG)

**Strengths:**
- Multiple methodologies provide different perspectives on market structure
- Identifies high-conviction support/resistance levels when methodologies align
- Differentiates between day trading, swing trading, and options strategy signals

**Limitations:**

- Provides clear visual representation of these key levels

**Limitations:**
- Wall detection doesn't fully incorporate delta exposure and recent flow
- Fixed volatility trigger thresholds don't adapt to market conditions
- Insufficient analysis of dealer positioning changes
- Limited real-time updating of levels throughout the trading day

### 2.3 High-Conviction Level Identification

**Current Implementation:**
- Based on simple alignment of metrics
- Uses fixed threshold for high-conviction designation
- Limited consideration of historical level performance
- Minimal tracking of level persistence

**Strengths:**
- Identifies levels with the highest probability of influencing price
- Provides a basis for high-conviction trade entries
- Differentiates between normal and high-conviction levels

**Limitations:**
- Simple metric alignment doesn't account for varying predictive power
